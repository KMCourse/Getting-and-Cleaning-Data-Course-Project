# Introduction

The script `run_analysis.R`performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

# Variables

* `x.train`, `y.train`, `x.test`, `y.test`, `subject.train` and `subject.test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x.data`, `y.data` and `subject.data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x.data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `features`.
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable.
* train.data using to Combine all columns in the training
* test.data using to Combine all columns in the testing
* using to megrate all data in train and test
